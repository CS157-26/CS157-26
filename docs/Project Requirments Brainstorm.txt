use adobe xd for gui prototyping. for the gui description, we should
prototype:
	the ticket entry modal
	main dashboard (filters on left, navigation/account info on top, main area ticket list)

google cloud offers a free mysql database with 500mb avaialable of storage. this means
that everyone in the group can share the same data, and pre load information for demos.

The project description can be coppied from the proposal, and we will be expanding on the areas:
System Environment
Functional Issues
Non-Functional Issues
